JavaScript Chatbot

Building a chatbot practising the Javascript parts together with a pair-buddy.
We have tried to build a chatbot similar to the example at Technigo, where you are approached with two different food alternatives.

## The problem

We started off by reading on our own to get a little bit more understanding of what the project involved. We then approached the problem by simply trying out different techniques and methods of practising the JavaScript. We had a look at the instructions and tips from Technigo, and we also had a look at stack overflow. Our planning could have been better, with specific goals throughout the week of what we wanted to have accomplished. We have not quiet finished the project. Hence, if we had more time we would try and finish the last bit of it. 

We were struggling with the functionality and how to call the next function.


## View it live

We tried to deploy it to Netifly but did not succeed.
